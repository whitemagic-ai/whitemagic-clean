# WhiteMagic v14 Unified Strategy — Research Synthesis & Execution Plan

**Date:** February 11, 2026
**Version:** v14.1.0 "Cognitive Enrichment"
**Sources:** 7 research team reports synthesized into unified execution plan
**Status:** Phases 1 & 3 Complete. Phases 2 & 4 deferred to v14.2+.

---

## Executive Summary

Seven independent research teams analyzed WhiteMagic against cutting-edge papers on high-frequency dispatch, swarm architectures, autonomous agent economies, 5D causal memory spaces, dream cycle protocols, living memory systems, and holographic-temporal retrieval. **Their findings converge on a single insight:**

> WhiteMagic has built extraordinary infrastructure — 19M associations, 110K memories, 5D holographic coordinates, compiled accelerators in 9 languages, a Rust StateBoard + EventRing nervous system — but most of it sits idle. The path to v14 is not building new subsystems. It's **activating and connecting** what already exists.

The 7 reports contain **6 critical overlaps** where teams independently identified the same gaps, and **4 emergent capabilities** that arise only when their recommendations are combined. This document fuses them into a single phased execution plan.

---

## Part I: The Overlap Map

Three or more teams independently flagged each of these gaps. Items that appear across multiple reports represent the highest-confidence priorities.

### Overlap A: The Untraversed Graph (Reports 4, 5, 6, 7)

**The single most-cited gap across all research.**

The 19M associations are created by `association_miner.py` and stored in SQLite — but **never walked**. All three retrieval modes (`search()`, `search_similar()`, `search_hybrid()`) are stateless single-hop lookups. No multi-hop traversal. No causal chaining. No graph reasoning.

| Report | What They Want | Why |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| **Holographic Gap** | `graph_walker.py` — weighted random walk | Multi-hop memory reasoning |
| **Dream Cycle** | `graph_engine.py` — networkx topology | Bridge discovery + echo chamber detection |
| **Living Memory** | Association decay + Hebbian strengthening | Edges currently never weaken |
| **5D Causal** | Directed causal edges + mining | "What caused this?" reasoning |

**Synthesis:** One graph infrastructure layer serves all four needs.

### Overlap B: Association Schema Upgrade (Reports 4, 5, 6, 7)

Four teams propose new columns on the `associations` table. Currently: `(source_id, target_id, strength, created_at, last_traversed_at, traversal_count)`.

| Report | Proposed Field | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Living Memory** | `edge_type` (episodic/semantic/consolidated) | Different decay curves |
| **Living Memory** | `valid_from`, `valid_until`, `ingestion_time` | Bitemporal modeling |
| **5D Causal** | `direction` (forward/backward/undirected) | Causal edge directionality |
| **Holographic Gap** | `relation_type` (associated/causes/part_of/...) | Typed traversal |
| **Dream Cycle** | Weight reduction for inhibition | Echo chamber governance |

**Synthesis:** ONE schema migration adds ALL fields at once. No repeated ALTER TABLEs.

### Overlap C: HNSW + HDBSCAN (Reports 4, 6)

Both the 5D Causal and Living Memory teams independently recommend:
- **HNSW** for cold storage search (105K memories, expected 300× speedup over brute-force)
- **HDBSCAN** to replace grid-based constellation detection (variable density, noise rejection)

Both are optional dependencies with graceful fallbacks. Add in same session.

### Overlap D: FFI + Nervous System (Reports 1, 2)

Two teams address the compiled layer:
- **HF PRAT:** Zig ctypes overhead is 7× theoretical (1,600ns vs 220ns). Fix: compile Zig into Rust PyO3 module.
- **Resonant Swarm:** StateBoard/EventRing are built but advisory, not authoritative. Fix: make them the primary path.

Both need `maturin develop --release`. FFI consolidation first, then wire the nervous system.

### Overlap E: Centrality / PageRank (Reports 5, 7)

- **Dream Cycle:** Eigenvector centrality for echo chamber detection in governance phase
- **Holographic Gap:** PageRank for topological gravity in graph walker

**Synthesis:** Compute centrality once via `graph_engine.py`, use in both graph walking (gravity signal) and dream governance (echo chamber detection).

### Overlap F: Memory Enrichment (Reports 4, 6)

- **5D Causal:** Shannon entropy + abstraction scores for every memory
- **Living Memory:** Surprise-gated ingestion (embedding novelty metric)

Both compute embedding-space metrics at store/enrich time. Build one enrichment pipeline.

---

## Part II: Emergent Capabilities

These capabilities arise **only** when multiple reports' recommendations are combined. No single report achieves them alone.

### Emergent 1: Predictive Memory (Reports 4 + 7)

Graph Walker (multi-hop traversal) + Causal Mining (directed edges) + Entropy Scores (complexity signals) = a system that can answer **"what might happen if X?"** by traversing causal chains weighted by complexity and centrality.

```
Query: "What happens if I refactor the association miner?"
  → Anchor search finds 5 nearest memories
  → Graph walker traverses 2 hops along causal edges
  → Discovers chain: refactor → test failures (0.8) → constellation shift (0.6)
  → Returns ranked predictions with reasoning paths
```

### Emergent 2: Self-Governing Knowledge (Reports 5 + 6)

Graph Governance (echo chamber detection via eigenvector centrality) + Association Decay (edges weaken with disuse) + Surprise Gate (novelty detection) = **a knowledge base that autonomously maintains its own health.**

- Echo chambers get detected during dream governance phase
- Their reinforcing edges naturally decay between cycles
- Novel information gets boosted; redundant info strengthens existing connections
- The dream cycle becomes genuinely autonomous — not just a maintenance routine

### Emergent 3: Zero-Overhead Compiled Pipeline (Reports 1 + 2)

FFI Consolidation (Zig-in-Rust, one FFI crossing) + Nervous System Wiring (StateBoard authoritative) + Expanded Dispatch (208 tools comptime) = **the entire pre-handler pipeline runs in <2µs compiled code.**

```
Before:  Python → ctypes → Zig (1,600ns) + Python → PyO3 → Rust (450ns) × 8 steps = ~40µs
After:   Python → PyO3 → Rust+Zig unified → handler = <2µs total
```

### Emergent 4: Verifiable Autonomous Agent (Reports 1 + 3)

WalletGovernor in Rust (memory-safe finance) + Ed25519 Signing + Karma XRPL Anchoring + WASM modules = **an agent that can cryptographically prove its ethical behavior**, handle real money safely, and distribute capabilities as sandboxed WASM modules. This is the full "Proof of Ethics" vision.

## Phase 1: The Living Graph (v14.0 headline feature)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Estimated:** ~1,800 LOC | **Impact:** TRANSFORMATIVE
**Theme:** Memory that thinks about itself.

### 1A: Association Schema Migration

ONE migration that satisfies all four research teams:

```sql
-- Satisfy all 4 reports in a single migration
ALTER TABLE associations ADD COLUMN direction TEXT DEFAULT 'undirected';
  -- 5D Causal: causal directionality
ALTER TABLE associations ADD COLUMN relation_type TEXT DEFAULT 'associated_with';
  -- Holographic Gap: typed traversal
ALTER TABLE associations ADD COLUMN edge_type TEXT DEFAULT 'semantic';
  -- Living Memory: episodic vs semantic decay curves
ALTER TABLE associations ADD COLUMN valid_from TEXT;
ALTER TABLE associations ADD COLUMN valid_until TEXT;
ALTER TABLE associations ADD COLUMN ingestion_time TEXT;
  -- Living Memory: bitemporal modeling
```

**Files:** `sqlite_backend.py` (migration) + `association_miner.py` (populate on creation)
**LOC:** ~80

### 1B: Graph Walker + Hybrid Recall

The #1 gap identified by the Holographic Gap Analysis. Enables multi-hop memory reasoning for the first time.

**New file:** `whitemagic/core/memory/graph_walker.py` (~400 LOC)
- `GraphWalker` class: loads neighbors from associations, computes transition probabilities
- `walk()`: k-hop weighted random walk from anchor nodes
- Transition score: `Semantic × Gravity^α × Recency × (1-Staleness)^β`
- All four signals already stored and indexed — walker just combines them
- Causality enforcement: `associations.created_at` filter for temporal ordering

**Modified:** `unified.py` — add `hybrid_recall()` method (~30 LOC)

### 1C: Graph Topology Engine

Foundation for both dream cycle governance and graph walker gravity.

**New file:** `whitemagic/core/memory/graph_engine.py` (~400 LOC)
- `build_graph()`: Construct networkx DiGraph from associations + KG relations
- `betweenness_centrality()`, `eigenvector_centrality()`: Standard networkx
- `bridging_centrality(v)`: betweenness × bridging_coefficient
- `detect_communities()`: Louvain/greedy modularity
- `find_bridge_nodes(top_n)`: Highest bridging centrality
- `centrality_snapshot()`: Store for T_now vs T_prev comparison
- Cache with TTL (rebuilt during dream cycle)

**Dependency:** `networkx` added to pyproject.toml extras

### 1D: Association Strength Decay

Edges currently never weaken. This violates every research team's recommendations.

**Modified files:**
- `sqlite_backend.py` — `decay_associations()` method
- `lifecycle.py` — Wire decay into lifecycle sweep Phase 4

**Math:**
- Episodic: `w(t) = w_prev × e^(-0.0231 × Δt_days)` (30-day half-life)
- Semantic: `w(t) = w_0 × (1 + 0.1 × Δt_days)^(-0.5)` (power-law, long tail)
- Hebbian strengthening: `w_new = min(1.0, w_old + 0.05 × (1.0 - w_old))` on co-access
- Pruning: associations with `w(t) < 0.05` removed

**LOC:** ~200

### 1E: Surprise-Gated Memory Ingestion

Balances plasticity (learning new concepts) vs stability (reinforcing existing knowledge).

**New file:** `whitemagic/core/memory/surprise_gate.py` (~200 LOC)
- `compute_surprise(embedding)`: `-log₂(max_cosine_similarity_to_existing)`
- High Surprise (S > 3.0): New concept → create + boost importance + emit NOVEL_CONCEPT
- Medium (1.0 < S ≤ 3.0): Store normally
- Low (S ≤ 1.0): Redundant → reinforce nearest neighbor instead of creating new memory

**Modified:** `unified.py` — wire surprise gate into `store()` method

### 1F: Dream Cycle Upgrades

Two new phases transform the dream cycle from maintenance to autonomous insight generation.

**Modified:** `dream_cycle.py`

**Serendipity upgrade:**
1. Build graph via `graph_engine.build_graph()`
2. Find top-5 bridge nodes via `find_bridge_nodes(5)`
3. For each bridge node: extract neighboring community themes → synthesize insight
4. Ollama LLM hypothesis generation (optional, graceful fallback to structured templates)

**New file:** `whitemagic/core/memory/bridge_synthesizer.py` (~200 LOC)

**New phase — GOVERNANCE:**
1. Compute eigenvector centrality
2. Compare with previous centrality snapshot
3. Flag nodes with centrality spike > 2σ WITHOUT corresponding new data → echo chamber
4. Inhibit reinforcing edges (reduce weight 50%, don't delete)
5. Log to Karma Ledger

**LOC:** ~230 total (dream_cycle modifications + bridge_synthesizer)

### 1G: Entity Resolution

**Modified:** `consolidation.py` — new `_cluster_by_embeddings()` method (~80 LOC)
1. Find near-duplicate pairs (cosine > 0.90)
2. Union-Find clustering
3. Select medoid (highest importance) as canonical
4. Push non-canonical to OUTER_RIM, boost canonical

## Part VIII: Success Criteria for v14.0

After Phases 1 and 2, the following must be true:

### Functional
- [ ] `hybrid_recall()` returns multi-hop reasoning paths from the association graph
- [ ] Dream cycle GOVERNANCE phase detects and inhibits echo chambers
- [ ] Dream cycle SERENDIPITY phase discovers bridge nodes and generates hypotheses
- [ ] Association edges decay with disuse (episodic fast, semantic slow)
- [ ] Surprise gate routes redundant memories to reinforcement, not creation
- [ ] Entity resolution merges near-duplicate memories via embeddings
- [ ] Dispatch pre-check runs in <2µs via compiled Zig+Rust pipeline
- [ ] StateBoard is authoritative source for HarmonyVector reads

### Performance
- [ ] FFI round-trip: <500ns (was 1,600ns)
- [ ] Pipeline pre-check: <5µs (was ~40µs)
- [ ] Event publish: <500ns via EventRing (was ~100µs via Redis)
- [ ] All existing tests pass (1,367+ currently)
- [ ] 30+ new tests covering graph walker, topology engine, living memory, dream governance

### Quality
- [ ] `wm doctor` reports health_score ≥ 0.8
- [ ] Zero new mypy strict errors on public surface
- [ ] All MCP modes functional (classic/lite/PRAT)
- [ ] PRAT responses include `_resonance`, `_garden`, and `_economics` metadata

## Part X: The v14 Narrative

**v14.0 "The Living Graph"** — Memory that thinks about itself. The 19M associations awaken: traversed for the first time via the graph walker, governed by the dream cycle's new eigenvector centrality phase, naturally decaying with disuse, and strengthened by Hebbian co-activation. The nervous system wiring makes all of this happen at compiled speed. WhiteMagic stops being a tool substrate and becomes a cognitive system.

**v14.1 "Cognitive Enrichment"** — The graph gains new senses. Entropy and abstraction scores add semantic dimensions. HNSW enables 300× faster cold storage search. HDBSCAN produces research-grade constellation detection. Causal mining discovers directed "why" edges. UMAP projects the 5D cognitive space into a visual map.

**v14.2 "The Autonomous Horizon"** — WhiteMagic becomes provably trustworthy and universally distributable. Ed25519-signed manifests, Karma roots anchored to XRPL, WASM capability modules, and formal PRAT pricing prepare the system for the machine economy.
