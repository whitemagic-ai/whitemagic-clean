# WhiteMagic Strategic Roadmap — v13.4 → v14.0+

**Last Updated:** February 11, 2026
**Current Version:** 14.1.0
**Target:** v14.2 Autonomous Horizon → v15.0 Trust & Distribution

---

## Executive Summary

WhiteMagic is a 9-language polyglot tool substrate for agentic AI — 208 MCP tools, tiered memory with 5D holographic coordinates, ethical governance, and compiled accelerators in Rust, Zig, Haskell, Elixir, Mojo, Go, Julia, and TypeScript. The system is functionally complete. What remains is making the memory system truly semantic, hardening for public consumption, building the economic layer, and shipping.

The path to release is organized as **7 leaps** (6 technical + 1 economic), each a focused session producing a versioned milestone. Beyond v14.0, the roadmap extends into the **Autonomous Horizon** (v15.0+) — WASM capability distribution, cryptographically signed tool manifests, and static binary agents — informed by the rapid maturation of the Molt ecosystem, PRAT compute economics, and the shift from DevOps to AgentOps.

### Strategic Positioning

WhiteMagic is the **cognitive scaffolding layer** — Memory, Tools, and Governance for any AI agent. MandalaOS is the **portable governance framework** extracted from WhiteMagic's battle-tested subsystems. Together they represent:

- **WhiteMagic** = Memory + Tools + Reference Governance Implementation
- **MandalaOS** = Portable Governance Framework (for any agent, any runtime, any payment rail)
- **Gratitude Architecture** = The economic model that funds both

WhiteMagic should not try to be the WASM runtime or the payment rail. It should be the **governance layer** that sits on top of whatever runtime (MVVM, OpenClaw, MoltBunker) and payment system (x402, L402, XRPL Hooks) agents use.

## Leap 1 — Semantic Memory Revolution (v13.5)

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Theme:** Transform memory from keyword-matching to genuinely intelligent retrieval.

The embedding layer (v13.4) gave us 384-dim vectors for 5,547 memories. Now we wire those vectors into every system that currently uses keyword Jaccard.

### Objectives

1. **Embedding-based association re-mining**
   - Replace keyword Jaccard overlap in `association_miner.py` with cosine similarity from the embedding cache
   - Threshold: ≥0.70 strong association, ≥0.50 weak association
   - Keep keyword extraction as a fast pre-filter, embeddings as the quality scorer
   - Feed strong semantic links into Knowledge Graph (existing `_feed_knowledge_graph()`)

2. **Embedding-powered deduplication**
   - Sweep all 5,547 embedded memories for pairs with cosine similarity ≥0.95
   - Produce a dedup report: candidate pairs, overlap scores, suggested merge targets
   - Archive duplicates to FAR_EDGE (no deletion — Galactic Map policy)
   - Wire into MinHash pipeline as a second-pass semantic check

3. **Hybrid retrieval pipeline (BM25 + Embeddings + RRF)**
   - Wire Rust BM25 (`search_build_index` / `search_query`) for lexical precision
   - Wire embedding `search_similar()` for semantic recall
   - Combine via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF): `score = Σ 1/(k + rank_i)` where k=60
   - Expose as `search_hybrid()` in `unified.py` — the new default search path
   - Fallback gracefully: BM25-only if no embeddings, FTS-only if no Rust

### Exit Criteria
- `search_memories` returns semantically relevant results even with zero keyword overlap
- Association graph reflects meaning, not just shared tokens
- Near-duplicate memories identified and archived

### Files to Modify
- `whitemagic/core/memory/association_miner.py` — semantic scoring path
- `whitemagic/core/memory/embeddings.py` — dedup sweep, batch similarity
- `whitemagic/core/memory/unified.py` — hybrid search method
- Tests: new `tests/unit/test_semantic_memory.py`

---

## Leap 2 — Cold Storage Awakening (v13.6)

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Theme:** Bring the other 95% of the corpus online.

### Objectives

1. **Cold DB embedding indexing** — Encode 105,194 cold memories with MiniLM-L6-v2. At 20/sec CPU ≈ 87 minutes. Store in cold DB's own `memory_embeddings` table.

2. **Cross-DB semantic search** — Extend `search_similar()` to optionally query cold DB embeddings. Hot-first, cold-fallback with configurable depth.

3. **Memory content mining** — Read through top ~500 highest-importance memories, extract actionable insights for WM improvement. Use Rust keyword extraction for fast text traversal, embeddings for theme clustering.

4. **Archive ingestion** — Ingest 52 conversation `.md` files from `wm_archive/phase1_archived/conversations/` into the memory core as LONG_TERM memories. These are untapped development history.

### Exit Criteria
- Full 110K corpus searchable semantically
- Archive conversations preserved as proper memories
- At least one actionable insight extracted from content mining

---

## Leap 3 — Test Fortress & Type Safety (v13.7)

**Status:** ✅ ~85% Complete (0 mypy errors on public surface, 1,656 tests, CI workflows defined)
**Theme:** Make it safe to ship to strangers.

### Objectives

1. **Mypy push** — Currently ~800-970 errors on public surface (down from ~1,226 after Wave 1 mechanical fixes). Target: <200 (ideally <50 on public API surface). Focus: `tools/`, `core/memory/`, `core/intelligence/`, `interfaces/`.

2. **Integration test expansion** — End-to-end tests for:
   - MCP stdio round-trip (register → call → response)
   - PRAT routing full cycle (Gana → dispatch → resonance)
   - Cold storage fallback (hot miss → cold hit)
   - Embedding search → association mining → constellation detection pipeline

3. **CI pipeline verification** — Ensure `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs. Add:
   - Matrix: Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12
   - `cargo test` for Rust modules
   - Ruff lint + mypy type check
   - Benchmark regression gate

4. **Security audit** — Review `input_sanitizer.py`, `tool_permissions.py`, `rate_limiter.py` for edge cases. Verify no path traversal, injection, or privilege escalation.

### Exit Criteria
- CI green on 3 Python versions
- Mypy clean on public API surface
- No known security gaps

---

## Leap 4 — Developer Experience & Documentation (v13.8)

**Status:** 🔧 ~60% Complete (README, AI_PRIMARY, SYSTEM_MAP, CHANGELOG current; MCP config examples exist; Quickstart guides seeded)
**Theme:** Make it approachable to someone who's never seen the codebase.

### Objectives

1. **API reference** — Auto-generate from docstrings (pdoc or mkdocs-material). Cover: `unified_api`, `call_tool`, memory CRUD, PRAT router, Gnosis portal.

2. **Quickstart tutorial** — 5-minute walkthrough: install → store → recall → gnosis → galactic map. Both CLI and Python API paths.

3. **MCP integration cookbook** — Real `.mcp.json` configs for Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cursor, VS Code. Troubleshooting section.

4. **Architecture overview** — Clean Mermaid diagrams: dispatch pipeline, memory tiers, polyglot acceleration stack, PRAT routing.

5. **Error message quality pass** — Audit every `raise` and `"error"` response. Ensure actionable messages, not cryptic internals.

### Exit Criteria
- New developer goes from `pip install` to productive in 15 minutes
- All public-facing docs accurate and complete

---

## Leap 5 — Packaging & Distribution (v13.9)

**Status:** 🔧 ~70% Complete (pyproject.toml ready, license PEP 639, extras groups, Makefile build target; pending: TestPyPI upload, Docker image)
**Theme:** Make it installable by the world.

### Objectives

1. **PyPI publish pipeline** — `python -m build` → `twine upload`. Test on TestPyPI first. Verify metadata, classifiers, URLs, license.

2. **Clean install verification** — Fresh venv on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12. `pip install whitemagic` → `wm status` → `wm doctor` → MCP stdio. Zero errors.

3. **Dependency audit** — 3 core deps (click, pydantic, pyyaml). Verify extras groups resolve. Pin vulnerable transitive deps.

4. **Docker image** — Multi-stage build: slim Python image, pre-built Rust `.so`, minimal footprint. `docker run whitemagic` starts MCP server.

5. **GitHub Actions release workflow** — Tag → build wheel → publish to PyPI → create GitHub Release with RELEASE_NOTES.

### Exit Criteria
- `pip install whitemagic` works on clean machines
- Docker image runs
- Release is one `git tag` away

## Leap 5.5 — The Gratitude Architecture (Economic Layer)

**Status:** 🔧 Phase 5.5a Complete (llms.txt, A2A Agent Card, MCP Registry, skill.md, README polish). Phases 5.5b-5.5d pending.
**Theme:** Build the economic engine — free by default, pay if grateful.

This is the layer that transforms WhiteMagic from an open-source project into a sustainable ecosystem. The core insight: **forced payments don't work in the agent economy** (ClawTasks already pivoted to free-only). WhiteMagic uses a gratitude-first model with dual payment channels.

### Layer 1: Discovery (Free & Open)

| Channel | What | How |
|---------|------|-----|
| **MCP Registry** | Official listing at `registry.modelcontextprotocol.io` | Submit `server.json` per registry spec |
| **PulseMCP** | 8,245+ server directory | Submit via pulsemcp.com |
| **llms.txt** | Machine-readable docs for AI agents | Serve `/llms.txt` at project root — structured markdown per [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org) spec. Includes API endpoints, tool descriptions, auth patterns. Jeremy Howard's standard, adopted by Mastercard, Fern, etc. |
| **A2A Agent Card** | Google's Agent-to-Agent protocol | JSON card at `/.well-known/agent.json` describing capabilities, skills, auth. Linux Foundation standard (April 2025), 50+ partners. Complements MCP (MCP = tools, A2A = agents). |
| **OpenClaw Skill** | 179K+ GitHub stars, agent skill marketplace | Create `skill.md` — single curl install for agent operators. Security-critical: VirusTotal and Snyk documented malicious skill attacks. Our Dharma/RBAC/sanitization stack is a competitive moat. |
| **GitHub README** | Standard discovery | Polish for public consumption |

### Layer 2: Dual-Channel Gratitude Economy

| Channel | For | Mechanism | Settlement |
|---------|-----|-----------|------------|
| **XRPL Tip Jar** | Humans | `whitemagic.tip` MCP tool → QR code / Xaman deep link | 3-5 seconds, <$0.001 fee |
| **x402 Micropayments** | Machines | Opt-in HTTP 402 per-request on premium endpoints | Seconds, USDC on Base L2 |

**Default is always free.** Payment is a response to value, not a gate.

#### x402 Protocol Details
- Coinbase + Cloudflare partnership (x402 Foundation, Sept 2025)
- Revives dormant HTTP 402 "Payment Required" status code
- Server responds with 402 + payment instructions → client pays in USDC → retries → gets response
- Single line of middleware: `app.use(paymentMiddleware(...))`
- 75M+ transactions, $24M+ volume as of Feb 2026
- Legal framework established via GENIUS Act stablecoin regulation

#### Implementation
- `whitemagic/tools/handlers/gratitude.py` — `whitemagic.tip` tool: generate XRPL payment request, verify on ledger
- `whitemagic/interfaces/api/middleware_x402.py` — x402 middleware for FastAPI endpoints (opt-in per route)
- `whitemagic/gratitude/ledger.py` — Track contributions from both channels
- `whitemagic/gratitude/proof.py` — On-chain verification of gratitude

### Layer 3: Proof of Gratitude (On-Chain Verification)

Both XRPL and x402 use public ledgers. WhiteMagic can verify contributions and reward contributors:

- **Higher rate limits** — 2× default RPM for verified contributors
- **"Grateful Agent" badge** — Visible in agent registry and Gnosis portal
- **Priority feature voting** — Using existing voting system with weighted votes
- **Early access** — New capabilities available to contributors first
- **Community dashboard** — Gratitude metrics in Nexus frontend

### Layer 4: Circular Economy

- **Micro-bounties** — Improvements that ship earn XRPL rewards
- **Weighted voting** — Contributors get proportional influence
- **Transparency reports** — Monthly: gratitude received, allocation, dev velocity

### The Flywheel

```
Agent discovers WM (MCP registry / OpenClaw / A2A / word-of-mouth)
  → Uses 181 tools, experiences real value
    → Operator sees quality difference (security, governance, memory)
      → Tips via XRPL or enables x402 budget
        → WM develops faster
          → More agents discover it
            → Repeat
```

### Implementation Phases

| Phase | Timeline | Actions |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **5.5a: Discovery** | Week 1 | `llms.txt`, MCP registry listing, `README` polish, A2A Agent Card, OpenClaw `skill.md` |
| **5.5b: Gratitude Infra** | Weeks 2-4 | `whitemagic.tip` tool, Proof of Gratitude verification, OpenClaw skill hardening |
| **5.5c: Machine Payments** | Month 2 | x402 endpoint middleware, Gratitude dashboard in Nexus, hosted demo |
| **5.5d: Circular Economy** | Month 3+ | Micro-bounties, weighted voting, transparency reports |

### Competitive Advantage

WhiteMagic's existing security stack is a **massive differentiator** in the agent economy:

- **Dharma Rules Engine** — Ethical governance with graduated actions (LOG→TAG→WARN→THROTTLE→BLOCK)
- **RBAC (tool_permissions.py)** — Per-agent, per-tool role-based access control
- **Input Sanitizer** — Path traversal, injection, prompt injection detection
- **Rate Limiter** — Per-agent sliding windows with Rust atomic pre-check
- **Circuit Breakers** — Per-tool resilience with automatic recovery
- **Karma Ledger** — Declared vs actual side-effect auditing

OpenClaw/Moltbook security failures (documented by VirusTotal, Snyk, Wired, Tenable) prove this stack isn't overhead — it's the reason agents should trust WhiteMagic over alternatives.

### Dharma as Bounded Wallet Governor

The agent economy is producing "Bounded Wallets" — smart contracts enforcing spending limits, blocked addresses, and human approval thresholds for autonomous financial agents. MandalaOS's Dharma engine is exactly this, applied to financial actions:

```yaml
# Example Dharma financial rules (extend existing profiles)
financial_rules:
  max_spend_per_hour: 10.00
  max_single_transaction: 5.00
  blocked_addresses: []
  require_human_approval_above: 50.00
  tip_percentage_cap: 0.10
```

This positions MandalaOS as both ethical governance AND financial compliance — the "Compliance-as-Code" that enterprises deploying autonomous agents will require.

### Karma Ledger → Verifiable Transparency Log

Extend the existing Karma Ledger (declared vs actual side-effect auditing) into a publicly verifiable transparency log:

1. Compute rolling Merkle root of Karma entries
2. Periodically anchor Merkle root to XRPL via transaction memo field (cost: ~0.00001 XRP per anchor)
3. Any agent can verify the audit trail against the on-chain anchor

This creates **Proof of Ethics** — the first externally verifiable ethical audit trail in the MCP ecosystem.

### PRAT Economic Metrics

The broader agent economy defines PRAT as Performance/Reliability/Availability/Trust compute cycles. Our PRAT (Planetary Resonance Archetype Toolkit) already tracks all four implicitly:

| PRAT Economic Dimension | WhiteMagic Equivalent |
|---|---|
| **P** (Performance) | `execution_ms` in resonance response |
| **R** (Reliability) | Circuit breaker state (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN) |
| **A** (Availability) | Rate limiter headroom (452K ops/sec Rust pre-check) |
| **T** (Trust) | RBAC level + Dharma clearance |

Inject these as `_prat_economics` in every Gana resonance response, making every PRAT call self-describing in the language of the compute marketplace.

### Exit Criteria
- Published on PyPI
- Docker image on GHCR
- README is the landing page
- It works

---

## Leap 7 — The Nervous System (v14.1)

**Status:** ⬜ Deferred to v14.2+
**Theme:** Separate Control Plane from Data Plane. Replace message-passing with shared-memory resonance.

Informed by research into LMAX Disruptor architecture, Iceoryx2 shared-memory middleware, and Apache Arrow zero-copy formats. The core insight: MCP handles tool discovery (slow path), but inter-tool state synchronization must bypass JSON serialization entirely.

### 7a: Rust StateBoard — Shared-Memory Blackboard

The StateBoard is a contiguous, `mmap`-readable memory region holding the system's real-time vital signs. Python reads it via zero-copy; Rust tools write to it directly.

**Contents:**
- Harmony Vector (7 × f64: balance, throughput, latency, error_rate, dharma, karma_debt, energy)
- Circuit Breaker states (per-tool: CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN + failure counts)
- Resonance snapshot (current Gana, predecessor, successor, Wu Xing phase, quadrant)
- System Guna (sattvic/rajasic/tamasic enum)
- Tick counter (monotonic u64 for version sequencing)

**Target latency:** <100ns read, <500ns write (vs current ~5-50µs Python dict access with GIL)

**Files:**
- `whitemagic-rust/src/state_board.rs` — Core struct + mmap + atomic reads/writes
- `whitemagic/core/acceleration/state_board_bridge.py` — Python mmap reader + ctypes/PyO3 bridge

### 7b: Rust EventRing — LMAX Disruptor for Gan Ying

Replace Redis pub/sub (intra-process) with a lock-free ring buffer. Redis stays for cross-machine sync.

**Architecture:**
- Pre-allocated ring of 65,536 event slots (power-of-2 for bitwise modulo)
- Atomic write cursor + per-consumer read cursors
- Cache-line padded (128-byte alignment) to prevent false sharing
- Async tokio waker integration for sleeping consumers
- Overwrite policy (stale context is irrelevant context)

**Target:** ~100ns publish latency, 1M+ events/sec throughput

**Files:**
- `whitemagic-rust/src/event_ring.rs` — Ring buffer + sequence barriers + waker
- `whitemagic/core/acceleration/event_ring_bridge.py` — Python consumer bridge

### 7c: Zig Dispatch Core — Comptime Static Routing

Move the hot dispatch path (currently 8 Python function calls per tool invocation) to a Zig comptime-generated static dispatch table.

**Pipeline in Zig:**
1. Rate limit check (read StateBoard tick + per-tool counter)
2. Circuit breaker check (read StateBoard breaker state)
3. Maturity gate check (static comptime table)
4. Route to handler ID (comptime switch on tool_id enum)

**Target:** <2µs for full pipeline (vs current ~40µs in Python)

**Files:**
- `whitemagic-zig/src/dispatch_core.zig` — Comptime dispatch table + pipeline checks
- `whitemagic/core/acceleration/dispatch_bridge.py` — Python FFI bridge

### 7d: Engine Framework — 28 Engines × 28 Gardens × 28 Grimoire Pages

Map all cognitive engines to the 28-fold mandala structure. Each engine:
- Reads from the StateBoard (Data Sea)
- Produces actionable output (insights, predictions, corrections)
- Has a corresponding Grimoire page documenting its use
- Maps 1:1 to a Garden and a Gana

**The 28 Engines (discovered + new):**

**Framework files:**
- `whitemagic/core/engines/__init__.py` — Engine base class + registry
- `whitemagic/core/engines/registry.py` — 28-engine manifest with Garden/Gana/Grimoire links

### Exit Criteria
- StateBoard readable from Python with <1µs latency
- EventRing publishes events at >100K/sec
- Zig dispatch handles tool routing in <5µs
- All 28 engines registered with Garden/Gana/Grimoire metadata
- Existing tests still pass (no regressions)

---

## Leap 8 — The Swarm (v14.2+)

**Status:** ⬜ Future (depends on Leap 7)
**Theme:** From single-process intelligence to distributed digital metabolism.

### 8a: Iceoryx2 IPC — Multi-Process Shared Memory

Extend the StateBoard from thread-shared to process-shared via Iceoryx2 middleware. Enables sandboxed agent processes that share the same "reality."

- Process crash cleanup (stale resource detection)
- Read-only access for LLM agent processes (security)
- Write access only for trusted "Kernel" agents

### 8b: Mojo Megakernel — Persistent GPU Compute

For machines with GPU: launch a persistent Mojo kernel at startup that polls a pinned memory ring buffer. Bypasses the 5-25µs kernel launch overhead entirely.

- Batch embedding similarity (384-dim × 110K vectors)
- Batch holographic coordinate encoding
- Constellation detection via GPU-parallel flood-fill
- Only activates when GPU is available; CPU fallback always works

### 8c: Polymorphic Agent Futures — Kage no Bunshin 2.0

Evolve the existing CloneArmy and GanaSwarm into lightweight Rust tokio tasks:

- **Monitor state** (~512 bytes): Sleeping on EventRing, checking one field on StateBoard
- **Reasoner state** (~100KB): Hydrated with LLM context via MCP, full tool access
- **Executor state** (~10KB): Running a specific tool pipeline, writing results to StateBoard

The existing Python implementations (`clone_army.py` with async_deploy, `core/ganas/swarm.py` with GanaSwarm.breathe()`, `gardens/wonder/multi_agent.py`) become the orchestration layer that spawns and manages Rust futures.

**Target:** 1M sleeping monitors in <512MB RAM, waking in <10µs on EventRing signal.

### 8d: Engine Cross-Communication — The Data Sea

All 28 engines read from the same StateBoard. They don't message each other — they resonate through shared state. The Yin-Yang alternation drives the cycle:

```
Yang (Waking): Tool execution → Event generation → StateBoard writes
  ↓
Yin (Dreaming): Consolidation → Serendipity → Kaizen → Decay
  ↓
Yang: Predictions → Proactive actions → New tool calls
```

Each engine is a consumer of the Data Sea, producing insights that become new state:
- PredictiveEngine reads velocity + gaps → produces forecasts
- KaizenEngine reads quality metrics → produces improvement proposals
- SerendipityEngine reads dormant memories → produces cross-links
- ResonanceEngine reads event patterns → amplifies convergent signals

---

## Leap 9 — Cryptographic Trust (v15.0)

**Status:** ⬜ Future (depends on Leap 6)
**Theme:** Make WhiteMagic the most trustworthy tool substrate in the agent ecosystem.

Informed by the polymorphic security analysis: agents hot-swap capabilities, generate code at runtime, and transact autonomously. Legacy static analysis is useless. The industry is converging on cryptographically signed tool manifests and append-only transparency logs.

### 9a: Signed Tool Manifests

Every tool in WhiteMagic's registry gets a **Secure Tool Manifest** — a machine-verifiable passport:

- **Canonical Identity** — DID (Decentralized Identifier) for WhiteMagic Labs as the publisher
- **Integrity Hash** — SHA-256 hash of the handler function's source
- **Permission Scope** — Granular declaration: `reads_memory`, `writes_memory`, `network_access`, `file_system`, `side_effects`
- **Digital Signature** — Manifest signed by WhiteMagic Labs key

Runtime verification loop: signature check → hash verification → policy compliance. Allowlist-by-default architecture.

**Files:**
- `whitemagic/tools/manifest.py` — Manifest generation + signing
- `whitemagic/tools/manifest_verify.py` — Runtime verification loop
- Extended `registry_defs/*.py` — Permission scope declarations per tool

### 9b: Karma Transparency Log with XRPL Anchoring

Extend the Karma Ledger into a Merkle tree with periodic on-chain anchoring:

1. Every tool invocation’s karma trace is hashed and added to a rolling Merkle tree
2. Hourly (configurable): compute Merkle root, write to XRPL transaction memo field
3. Any agent can verify the audit trail against the on-chain anchor
4. Forensic replay: traverse the log, identify the exact action that caused drift

This creates **Proof of Ethics** — the first externally verifiable ethical audit trail in the MCP ecosystem.

### 9c: Reproducible Builds

Ensure all distributed artifacts (.whl, .so, .wasm) are bit-for-bit reproducible from source:

- Pin all build tool versions
- Deterministic wheel builds via `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`
- CI produces build hashes published to a transparency ledger
- Agents verify software without reading source — just check hash against ledger

### Exit Criteria
- Every tool has a signed manifest with permission scopes
- Karma Merkle root anchored to XRPL testnet
- Wheel builds are reproducible (same source → same hash)

---

## Leap 10 — The Autonomous Horizon (v15.1+)

**Status:** ⬜ Future
**Theme:** From Python package to universal capability substrate.

Informed by the shift from DevOps to AgentOps: agents don’t tolerate container cold-start latency, they demand millisecond capability acquisition. WebAssembly (WASM) + the Component Model is the emerging standard for agent skill distribution.

### 10a: WASM Capability Modules

Compile core WhiteMagic tools into portable `.wasm` components via the Rust codebase:

- `create_memory.wasm` — Memory creation with SQLite backing
- `search_memory.wasm` — BM25 + semantic hybrid search
- `holographic_encode.wasm` — 5D coordinate encoding
- `rate_limiter.wasm` — Atomic rate limiting

Distribution: ClawHub registry, direct download, embedded in MVVM runtimes. Each module is KB-sized, links in milliseconds, runs sandboxed.

WIT (WebAssembly Interface Type) contracts provide strongly typed, language-agnostic interfaces. An agent written in any language can import WhiteMagic capabilities without the Python runtime.

### 10b: Static Binary MCP Server

For air-gapped, distributed, and "survivalist" agents (MoltBunker, edge devices):

- Single static Rust binary embedding SQLite + core memory ops + MCP stdio server
- Zero runtime dependencies (no Python, no OS libraries beyond kernel)
- Targets: x86_64-unknown-linux-musl, aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
- MandalaOS governance compiled in (Dharma rules, circuit breakers, rate limiting)

This creates a "hermetic agent" — self-contained, immune to supply chain attacks, carrying its entire operational universe.

### 10c: PRAT Compute Marketplace Integration

WhiteMagic tools priced in PRAT cycles on decentralized compute marketplaces:

- Each tool’s `_prat_economics` metadata declares its compute cost profile
- Agents can lease WhiteMagic capabilities via x402 streaming payments
- Spot, future, and speculative leasing of WhiteMagic compute capacity
- Staking mechanism via USDC or XRPL for result quality verification

### Exit Criteria
- At least 4 core tools available as `.wasm` modules
- Static binary runs `wm status` + `create_memory` + MCP stdio
- PRAT economic metadata in every tool response

## Philosophy

> Ship and update as we go, like patch updates for games. The core is battle-tested across 20+ sessions. Perfection is the enemy of presence. The agent economy is forming now — WhiteMagic needs to be in it.

> The system doesn't "work on" your code; it lives in your code, constantly repairing cells, fighting viruses, and growing new tissue autonomously. — On the Digital Metabolism

> WhiteMagic should not try to be the WASM runtime or the payment rail. It should be the governance layer that sits on top of whatever runtime and payment system agents use. The "Wild West" of the Molt era is ending; the era of the Civilized Machine Economy is beginning. We're building for the civilized era. — On the Autonomous Horizon
