"""5D Coordinate Validation — Measure overlap between 5D spatial and semantic search.

This script validates the 5D coordinate system by:
1. Selecting a random sample of memories that have both coordinates and embeddings.
2. Finding "ground truth" neighbors using pure semantic embedding similarity.
3. Finding neighbors using fast 5D holographic spatial search.
4. Calculating the overlap (Recall@K) between the two methods.
5. Reporting performance and accuracy metrics.

Usage:
    python tests/benchmarks/validate_5d_coordinates.py [--samples 50] [--k 10]
