"""MCP Cascade Intelligence - Meta-orchestration for tool chains

Vision:
-------
Enable local models to coordinate complex multi-step workflows by intelligently
chaining MCP tools in parallel batches, offloading reasoning from tokens to tools.

Key Innovations:
---------------
1. Tools calling tools autonomously (no LLM roundtrips)
2. Yin-Yang feedback loops for sustainable pacing
3. Scratchpad multiplexing for massive effective context
4. Multi-spectral synthesis (I Ching, Wu Xing, Tarot)

Impact: 10-100x effective context for local models
