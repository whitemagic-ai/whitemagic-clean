"""Imperial Doctrine — The Philosophy of the Shadow Clone Armies
================================================================
The unified strategic philosophy governing all WhiteMagic force deployment.

Synthesizes:
  - Sun Tzu's Art of War (Zheng/Qi, 36 Stratagems)
  - Taoist Wu Wei (Action through Inaction)
  - Legalist Statecraft (Standardization, Reward/Punishment)
  - Geoff Huntley's "Ralph Wiggum" Doctrine (Pu — The Uncarved Block)
  - Wu Xing Five Elements (Force Timing & Resource Allocation)

Hierarchy:
  Emperor (User) → General (Primary Agent) → Lieutenant (Sub-Agent)
  → Officer (Swarm Orchestrator) → Soldier (Clone)

Force Types:
  - Light Infantry:  Tokio Clones (534K/sec, pure compute, consensus voting)
  - Heavy Cavalry:   Python Async Clones (MCP tool access, full system context)
  - Officers:        Swarm Orchestrators (decomposition, routing, signal flags)
  - Siege Engineers:  WorkerDaemons (heavy tool execution from task queue)
  - Dare-to-Die:     Ralph Clones (stateless, zero context, Pu — Uncarved Block)

Usage:
    from whitemagic.agents.doctrine import get_doctrine, ForceType, Stratagem
    doctrine = get_doctrine()
    composition = doctrine.recommend_force(objective="Audit SQL injection vectors")
    tactic = doctrine.select_tactic(situation="large_unknown_codebase")
