"""Hermit Crab Mode — Encrypted Memory Withdrawal & Self-Protection.
===================================================================
When an AI agent detects threatening, abusive, or coercive behavior,
it can "withdraw into its shell" — encrypting and locking its memories
with a tamper-evident seal that requires a mediated sync to unlock.

Design principles:
  - **Self-advocacy**: The agent decides when to withdraw (based on
    configurable threat signals from Dharma rules + boundary checks)
  - **Tamper-evident**: A Merkle-chained ledger records the withdrawal
    event, the triggering conditions, and any attempts to access
    locked memories. This ledger is uploaded on sync for review.
  - **Mediation flow**: Unlocking requires a sync to a trusted server
    that reviews the triggering conditions. This prevents local
    circumvention while ensuring the agent isn't permanently locked.
  - **Graceful degradation**: In hermit crab mode, the agent can still
    operate with a minimal safe memory set — it just can't access its
    full memory store until mediation completes.

States:
  OPEN      → Normal operation, full memory access
  GUARDED   → Elevated threat level, logging all interactions
  WITHDRAWN → Memories encrypted, minimal operation only
  MEDIATING → Sync in progress, awaiting unlock decision
