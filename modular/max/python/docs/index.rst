The MAX Python API reference.

The MAX API provides a high-performance graph compiler and runtime library that
executes AI models with incredible speed on a wide range of hardware.

MAX offers a layered architecture that lets you work at the level of abstraction
that best fits your needs. From deploying production-ready models with a few
lines of code to building custom neural networks from scratch, each layer builds
upon the others so you can move between levels seamlessly as requirements evolve.

For an introduction, see the
`Model developer guide </max/develop/>`_.
