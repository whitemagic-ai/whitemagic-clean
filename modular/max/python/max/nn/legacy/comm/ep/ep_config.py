"""Expert Parallelism (EP) Communication Configuration."""

from max.dtype import DType
from max.nn.legacy.float8_config import Float8Config

# We always use two groups of SHMEM shared memory buffers to avoid race
# conditions between the dispatch and combine phases of Expert Parallelism
# communication.
#
# Expert Parallelism consists of two sequential phases, each with two kernels:
# 1. Dispatch phase: Route tokens to experts on different GPUs
#    - dispatch_async_kernel: Initiates token transfer
#    - dispatch_wait_kernel: Ensures current GPU received all tokens from other
#      GPUs
# 2. Combine phase: Return expert outputs to original GPUs
#    - combine_async_kernel: Initiates expert output transfer
#    - combine_wait_kernel: Ensures current GPU received all expert outputs
#
# When dispatch_wait_kernel completes on the current GPU, it only guarantees that
# THIS GPU has received all tokens. Other GPUs may still be writing to their
# dispatch buffers or reading their own receive buffers. Therefore, we cannot
# safely reuse dispatch phase buffers for the combine phase.
#
# We use dedicated buffers for each phase. When combine_wait_kernel completes, it
# guarantees all GPUs have at least started their combine_async_kernel, which implies
# they've finished their dispatch_wait_kernel. Only then is it safe to reuse the
# dispatch buffers for the next iteration.
