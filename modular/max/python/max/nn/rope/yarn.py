            of the complex valued embedding is considered its own dim.
        base: Scaling factor for the frequency.
        max_sequence_length: The number of positional embeddings to compute.
            (`L'`). By convention produce twice the vector size.
        original_max_sequence_length: The original maximum sequence length
            (`L`) the model was trained with. The _scale factor_ `s` of the
            computation is set to `L' / L`.
