class TextBatchConstructor:
    """Construct per-replica text batches from CE (prefill) and TG queues.

    This class encapsulates the high-level policy for forming execution
    batches for text pipelines. It operates on two logical phases of each
    request:

    - **Context encoding (CE / prefill)**: processing prompt tokens.
    - **Token generation (TG / decode)**: generating continuation tokens for
      already-prefilled requests.

    The batching policy is expressed entirely in terms of scheduler
    configuration (:class:`TokenGenerationSchedulerConfig`), model context
    metadata (e.g., lengths and LoRA adapter names), and KV cache / resource
    limits. The sections below describe the *intended behaviour* rather than
    the exact implementation.

    .. note::
       When chunked prefill is enabled and a request is split across multiple
       CE iterations, no output is emitted for that request until its full
       prefill completes. The request remains in the CE queue across
       iterations until all prompt tokens have been processed.

    **Replica assignment**

    The constructor supports data-parallel execution across
    ``data_parallel_degree`` replicas:

    - Each replica maintains its own CE and TG queues and forms batches
      independently using the same policy.
    - New requests are assigned to replicas using load-based assignment,
      which selects the replica with the fewest active requests. This
      provides better load balancing than round-robin, particularly when
      request sizes vary significantly or when requests complete at
      different rates.
    - The replica with the minimum request count is selected based on
      information from the paged KV cache manager. This accounts for
      both active processing and queued requests.
    - All replicas share the same logical KV memory budget through the
      paged KV cache manager.

    **Non-LoRA batch construction**

    The following describes batch construction when no LoRA manager is
    attached.

    **1. CE vs TG prioritization**

    For each replica the constructor maintains separate CE and TG queues.
    Priority depends on the ``enable_in_flight_batching`` setting:

    - When **False** (default):

      - If there are any CE requests waiting, the constructor prioritises
        building a CE batch until the CE queue is drained or budgets / limits
        are reached.
      - TG batches are formed only when there is no CE work pending on that
        replica. This favours fast admission of new prompts at the cost of
        slightly higher latency for ongoing generations.

    - When **True**:

      - If there are TG requests, the constructor prioritises TG, building a
        TG batch first and then optionally filling any remaining capacity in
        that iteration with CE work.
      - CE-only batches are formed when there is no TG work on the replica.
      - This favours throughput and inter-token latency for active
        generations at the cost of time-to-first-token for new requests, while
        still opportunistically progressing prefill when there is headroom.

    **2. Token budgets**

    Two logical token budgets can limit batch size. A context is admitted to
    the batch only if *all* active budgets agree that it fits. Budgets may
    report that:

    - Additional contexts can be admitted.
    - The current context should be admitted but further admissions in this
      batch should stop.
    - The context cannot fit and should be deferred to a later batch.

    *Active-token budget*

    - Capacity: ``target_tokens_per_batch_ce``.
    - Interprets the current active window of each context and enforces a soft
      limit on how many prompt tokens are processed in one CE batch.
    - When ``enable_chunked_prefill`` is **True**, large prompts may be
      *chunked* so that only a prefix of the prompt is processed in the
      current CE batch. The remainder is scheduled for follow-up CE
      iterations. This allows the constructor to:

      - Fill CE batches to approximately ``target_tokens_per_batch_ce``
        tokens.
      - Admit very large prompts without blocking the batch behind a single
        oversized request.

    - When chunked prefill is **disabled**, prompts are either admitted in
      full or deferred to a later batch once the active-token budget has been
      reached.

    *Total-context budget (optional)*

    - Enabled when ``max_batch_total_tokens`` is not ``None``.
    - Tracks the total resident context across the batch, accounting for
      current context length and planned forward steps, and ensures the sum
      does not exceed ``max_batch_total_tokens``.
    - This budget is only applied when a CE request is present, or to be
      added to the batch.

    **3. Max batch size limits**

    Independently of token budgets, explicit batch-size caps ensure that no
    batch grows without bound:

    - ``max_batch_size`` limits the number of requests in a batch per replica.

    Once a batch reaches its respective maximum size, no further requests are
    considered for that iteration, even if token budgets or cache capacity
    would allow more.

    **4. Decode step limits**

    The number of decode steps per TG iteration is bounded by
    ``max_forward_steps_tg``. When ``max_seq_len`` is provided, the final
    number of decode steps for an iteration is the *minimum* of
    ``max_forward_steps_tg`` and the number of steps each request can run
    before reaching ``max_seq_len``.

    **5. KV cache watermark and memory pressure**

    When a paged KV cache is used, KV memory becomes an additional limiting
    factor:

    - During CE, the constructor estimates how many KV blocks would be used if
      a candidate request were admitted.
    - If admitting the request would push usage above ``kvcache_ce_watermark``
      *and* there is active TG work on the replica, the request is deferred to
      protect room for ongoing generations. This prevents CE from starving
      existing TG batches of KV memory.
    - During TG, if allocating KV blocks for a candidate request fails due to
      insufficient capacity, the constructor may preempt other TG candidates
      to free KV space, ensuring that at least a subset of requests can
      continue generating. When preemption is required, the constructor evicts
      the most recently enqueued TG request first, minimising wasted work. A
      warning is logged when this occurs.

    Overall, KV cache limits, token budgets, and max batch sizes jointly
    determine the final CE and TG batch composition for each iteration.

    **LoRA batch construction**

    When a :class:`LoRAManager` is attached, the constructor applies
    additional constraints to respect the maximum number of concurrently
    loaded LoRA adapters and to avoid evicting adapters needed for active
    generations.

    - LoRA and data parallelism are mutually exclusive: if a LoRA manager is
      present, ``data_parallel_degree`` must be 1 so that all LoRA state is
      local to a single replica.
    - Each replica tracks a set of *protected* active LoRAs that are currently
      participating in the TG batch and must not be evicted.

    **1. CE batching with LoRA**

    For CE requests that target LoRA-adapted models:

    - A LoRA request is admitted into the CE batch only if activating its
      adapter would not exceed the LoRA manager's capacity, taking into
      account:

      - The protected LoRAs already in use by TG.
      - Any additional LoRAs the constructor intends to activate in this CE
        iteration.

    - If admitting a new LoRA request would require evicting a protected LoRA,
      that request is temporarily deferred and re-queued for a later CE batch,
      rather than forcing an eviction that would disrupt ongoing TG work.
    - When a LoRA request is finally admitted to CE, its adapter is activated
      and tracked as active for the replica, so that subsequent TG iterations
      can safely use it.

    This ensures that CE never "steals" LoRA capacity away from requests that
    are currently generating tokens.

    **2. TG batching with LoRA**

    For TG requests that depend on LoRA adapters:

    - The constructor requires that the corresponding LoRA adapter is
      currently active. If it is not, the request is *preempted* from the TG
      batch, reset, and returned to CE so that its LoRA weights can be safely
      reloaded in a future batch. A warning is logged when this occurs.
    - TG batches therefore only ever contain LoRA requests for which the
      correct adapters are already resident, guaranteeing that generations are
      computed with the intended LoRA parameters.
