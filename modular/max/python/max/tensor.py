"""Provides tensor operations with eager execution capabilities.

This module provides the :class:`~max.tensor.Tensor` class which supports
eager execution of tensor operations, complementing the graph-based execution
model provided by :obj:`~max.graph`. The tensor operations automatically compile
and execute using the MAX runtime.

**Key Features:**

- **Eager semantics**: Operations give immediate results for quick iteration and feedback.
- **High performance**: All operations use high-performance Mojo implementations
    compiled specifically for the available hardware.
- **Automatic compilation**: Tensors are compiled and optimized automatically.
    Operations may be easily fused into larger graphs to take advantage of
    the graph compiler's automatic fusions.
- **Lazy evaluation**: Tensors may be computed lazily until their values are needed.
- **Familiar API**: Supports common array operations and indexing.

.. note::

  Tensors use lazy evaluation and JIT compilation, which incurs compilation
  overhead on first execution. This can result in higher latency for initial
  operations compared to eager frameworks like NumPy or PyTorch. Subsequent
  executions reuse compiled kernels for better performance.

Create and manipulate tensors with automatic compilation and optimization:

.. code-block:: python

    from max.tensor import Tensor
    from max.driver import CPU
    from max.dtype import DType

    # Create and operate on tensors
    x = Tensor.ones((2, 3), dtype=DType.float32, device=CPU())
    y = Tensor.zeros_like(x)
    result = x + y  # Eager execution with automatic compilation

Operations may be combined into a single execution graph to take advantage
of automatic kernel fusion:

.. code-block:: python

    from max import functional as F

    @F.functional
    def linear(x: Tensor, weight: Tensor, bias: Tensor) -> Tensor:
        return x @ weight.T + bias

    # Create and operate on tensors
    x = Tensor.ones([2, 3])
    weight = Tensor.ones([6, 3])
    bias = Tensor.ones([6])

    # Eager execution with a single fused graph
    result = linear(x, weight, bias)

Users may opt in to lazy execution. This is primarily useful for
1. Operations which may never execute, for instance creating modules
with randomly initialized weights before loading weights
2. Combining many operations into a single execution

.. code-block:: python

    from max.nn import Linear

    with F.lazy():
        model = Linear(2, 3)

    print(model)  # Lazy weights not initialized

    # Load pretrained weights
    weights =  {
        "weight": Tensor.zeros([3, 2]),
        "bias": Tensor.zeros([3]),
    }
    model.load_state_dict(weights)

    # Or compile directly without ever initializing weights
    from max.graph import TensorType
    input_type = TensorType(DType.float32, ["batch", 2], CPU())
    model = model.compile(input_type, weights=weights)

    """Implements a way to realize unrealized tensors.

    Most users should never have to think about the existence of this type.
    It exists to facilitate optimizations around where and when tensor
    operations are executed.

    - Each tensor is either `real` or associated with a RealizationContext.
    - If a tensor is not `real`, ie. "unrealized", then it is backed by some
      symbolic computation.
    - The RealizationContext is responsible for tracking this symbolic
      computation and "realizing" the tensor (executing the computation and
      backing the tensor with real data) if and when it is asked to do so.
    - A RealizationContext can only realize tensors associated with it.

    RealizationContext abstracts over various semantics of tensor construction.

    **"Eager" execution**: tensors are realized as soon as the realization context
    exits. This is the default behavior.

    This has a huge concrete advantage over eagerly executing one operation
    at a time: by controlling the boundary of where the eager context starts
    and ends, we can give advanced users a tool to _enable fine-grained
    bounds for automatic fusion!

    In practice the easiest way to do this is to mark a function as
    `F.functional`. This function is then assumed to be "atomic" for the
    purposes of eager execution. All ops within the function execute as
    part of the same graph, meaning the compiler is free to fuse operations
    and generate fused kernels within this region.

    **"Lazy" execution**: tensors are realized only when code later tries to use
    them.

    This enables a class of interface design common in the ML world, in
    which layers are constructed with randomized weights which are never
    used. Lazy execution neatly allows constructing entire models,
    only performing the weight initialization and allocating memory for
    them if and when those weights are actually used.

    **Graph compilation**: tensors may never be realized.

    This allows tensor operations to be composed with direct usage of
    the Graph API, for instance `Module.compile`, or using `F.*` operations
    in another Graph API usage.

    **Async execution**: Tensors are realized as `async` functions,
    allowing clean integration in async systems like web services.

    **Key Features:**

    - **High performance**: Uses the Mojo compiler and optimized kernels.
    - **Familiar API**: Supports common array operations and indexing.
    - **Device flexibility**: Works seamlessly across CPU and accelerators.

    **Creating Tensors:**

    Create tensors using factory methods like :meth:`ones`, :meth:`zeros`,
    :meth:`constant`, :meth:`arange`, or from other array libraries via
    :meth:`from_dlpack`.

        print(result.shape)  # (2, 3)
        print(result.dtype)  # DType.float32

    **Implementation Notes:**

    Tensors use lazy evaluation internally - they don't always hold concrete
    data in memory. A tensor may be "unrealized" (not yet computed) until its
    value is actually needed (e.g., when converting to other formats or calling
    :meth:`item`). This allows the runtime to optimize sequences of
    operations efficiently.

    Operations on tensors build a computation graph behind the scenes, which is
    compiled and executed when needed. All illegal operations fail immediately
    with clear error messages, ensuring a smooth development experience.

    .. note::

      The lazy evaluation model and JIT compilation introduce compilation overhead
      on first execution of operations. This results in higher latency for
      interactive operations compared to eager frameworks like NumPy or PyTorch,
      particularly when materializing tensor values (e.g., printing or converting
      to other formats). Subsequent operations on similar shapes and dtypes reuse
      compiled kernels for improved performance.

    **Interoperability:**

    Tensors support the DLPack protocol for zero-copy data exchange with NumPy,
    PyTorch, JAX, and other array libraries. Use :meth:`from_dlpack` to import
    arrays and standard DLPack conversion for export.
