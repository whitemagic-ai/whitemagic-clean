    Will optimize a linear chain of side-effecting operations.

    Consider a case where we have two separate mo.buffers and the following

    Even though `%buf0` and `%buf1` are entirely different mo.buffer values the

    means the side-effecting operations on `%buf1` must unnecessarily wait for
    the operations on `%buf1` to complete.

    For mo.mutable.store ops:
      Erase a store when it is followed by another store operating on the same
      buffer and the first store's output chain

      ```
      %ch1 = mo.mutable.store(%ch0, %buffer, %tensor)
