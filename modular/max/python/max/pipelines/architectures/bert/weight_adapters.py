"""Weight adapters for Bert models.

This module converts HuggingFace BERT weight names to MAX weight names.

HuggingFace Bert naming convention:
- embeddings.word_embeddings.weight
- embeddings.LayerNorm.weight
- encoder.layer.0.attention.self.query.weight
- pooler.dense.weight (not used for embeddings)

MAX naming convention:
- embeddings.word_embeddings.weight
- embeddings.layer_norm.weight
- encoder.layer.0.attention.self.query.weight
