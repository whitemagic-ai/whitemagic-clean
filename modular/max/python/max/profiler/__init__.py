"""Performance profiling and tracing utilities for MAX.

This module provides tools for profiling and tracing MAX operations to analyze
performance characteristics. Profiling captures timing information for code
execution, which helps identify bottlenecks and optimize your models.

To enable profiling, set the ``MODULAR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1`` environment
variable before running your code. Without this variable, profiling calls will
be no-ops with minimal overhead.

The profiler supports three usage patterns:

1. **Context manager**: Use :class:`Tracer` as a context manager to profile a
   code block.
2. **Decorator**: Use :func:`@traced <traced>` to profile entire functions.
3. **Manual stack**: Use :class:`Tracer` methods to explicitly control profiling
   spans.
