    Args:
        original_vals: The list of symbolic tensor values to concatenate. Each tensor must have the same
            dtype and rank, and must have the same dimension size for each
            dimension other than ``axis``.
        axis: The axis to concatenate along. If negative, indexes relative
            to the end of the tensor shape. For instance, ``concat(vs, -1)``
            will concatenate along the last dimension.

    Returns:
        A new symbolic tensor representing the concatenation result. It will
        have the same rank as each input tensor, and its dimensions will be the same
        as each input tensor's for each dimension other than `axis`, which will
        have size equal to the sum of all tensor's size for that dimension.
