    The number and order of the elements in the tensor is unchanged.
    In other words, if you were to iterate over elements in the tensor
    by major dimension to minor dimension, the iteration order would stay
    the same.

    If a value of -1 is present in the shape, that dimension becomes
    an automatically calculated dimension collecting all unspecified dimensions.
    Its length becomes the number of elements in the original tensor
    divided by the product of elements of the reshape.

    Args:
        x: The input symbolic tensor to reshape.
        shape: The new shape as a list of dimensions.
               A single dimension may be `-1`.

    Returns:
        A symbolic tensor with the same elements as the original tensor, but
        in a new shape. Its symbolic shape is the same as :code:`shape`.

        ValueError: if input and target shapes' number of elements mismatch.
