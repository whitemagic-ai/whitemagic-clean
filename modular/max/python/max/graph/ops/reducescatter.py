    """Collective reduce-scatter summation operation.

    This op is a collective op which takes in tensors from different devices
    and outputs tensors on different devices. Each device reduces (via
    summation) and stores a disjoint partition of the inputs from all devices.

    Args:
        inputs: The input tensors to reduce and scatter.
        signal_buffers: Device buffer values used for synchronization.
        axis: The axis along which to scatter the reduced result. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
        An iterable of outputs where each device receives its portion of the
        scattered result. The output shape on each device is the input shape
        with dimension `axis` divided by the number of devices.
