    implemented in C++, this class does not allocate any Python objects when
    manipulating the linked list. Instead, this class manipulates the
    prev_free_block and next_free_block attributes of the given blocks.

    The queue is ordered by block ID in the beginning. When a block is allocated
    and then freed, it will be appended back with the eviction order:
    1. The least recent used block is at the front (LRU).
    2. If two blocks have the same last accessed time (allocated by the
       same sequence), the one with more hash tokens (the tail of a block
       chain) is at the front.
    Note that we maintain this order by reversing the block order when free
    blocks of a request. This operation is outside of this class.
