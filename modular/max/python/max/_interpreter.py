"""MO graph interpreter for eager execution.

This module provides an interpreter for MO (Modular Operation) graphs that can
execute operations directly without going through the full compilation pipeline.
This is useful for eager mode execution where compilation latency needs to be
minimized.

The interpreter walks through the MO graph in topological order and dispatches
each operation to an appropriate handler. Handlers can implement operations
using NumPy or by calling into Mojo kernels.

Example usage:
    from max._interpreter import MOInterpreter

    interp = MOInterpreter()
    outputs = interp.execute(graph, input_buffers)
