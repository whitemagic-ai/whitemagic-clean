# Benchmarking a MAX endpoint

> [!CAUTION]
> This guide is for MAX framework developers (Git repo developers).
> If you're using MAX as an application developer (via the `modular` package),
> you should instead use the `max benchmark` command line tool—see the more
> detailed guide to [benchmark MAX on
> GPUs](https://docs.modular.com/max/deploy/benchmark).

This guide describes how to benchmark the performance of a MAX model
server—measuring throughput, latency, and resource utilization—using
`benchmark_serving.py`. You can use this script to compare other serving
backends, namely [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), against MAX.

Key features:

- Tests any OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint
- Supports both chat and completion APIs
- Measures detailed latency metrics
- Works with hosted services

> The `benchmark_serving.py` script is adapted from
> [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/benchmarks),
> licensed under Apache 2.0. We forked this script to ensure consistency with
> vLLM's measurement methodology and extended it with features we found helpful,
> such as client-side GPU metric collection via `max.diagnostics`.

## Basic usage

You can benchmark any HTTP endpoint that implements
OpenAI-compatible APIs as follows:

```bash
python benchmark_serving.py \
  --model google/gemma-3-27b-it \
  --backend modular \
  --endpoint /v1/chat/completions \
  --dataset-name sonnet \
  --num-prompts 500 \
  --sonnet-input-len 512 \
  --output-lengths 256 \
  --sonnet-prefix-len 200
```

To see all the available options, run:

```sh
python benchmark_serving.py --help
```

For more information, see the [`max benchmark`
documentation](/max/cli/benchmark).

## Config files

When you want to save your benchmark configurations, you can define them in a
YAML file and pass it with the `--config-file` option.

The YAML file supports all the same properties as the `benchmark_serving.py`
arguments, except in the YAML file the properties **must use `snake_case`
names** instead of hyphenated names—for example, `--num-prompts` becomes
`num_prompts`. And all properties must be nested under a top level
`benchmark_config` key. For example:

```sh
benchmark_config:
  model: google/gemma-3-27b-it
  backend: modular
  endpoint: /v1/chat/completions
  dataset_name: sonnet
  ...
```

To help you reproduce our own benchmarks, we've made some of our config files
available in the [`configs`](configs/) directory. For example, copy our
[`gemma-3-27b-sonnet-decode-heavy-prefix200.yaml`](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/benchmark/configs)
file from GitHub, and you can benchmark Gemma3-27B with this command:

```sh
max benchmark --config-file gemma-3-27b-sonnet-decode-heavy-prefix200.yaml
```

## Output

Results are printed to the terminal but you can also save a JSON-formatted
file by adding the `--save-result` flag. It's saved to the local directory
with this naming convention:

```bash
{backend}-{request_rate}qps-{model_name}-{timestamp}.json
```

You can change the file name with `--result-filename` and change the directory
with `--result-dir`.

The output in the terminal should look similar to the following:

```bash

### Key metrics explained

- **Request throughput**: Number of complete requests processed per second
- **Input token throughput**: Number of input tokens processed per second
- **Output token throughput**: Number of tokens generated per second
- **TTFT**: Time to first token (TTFT), the time from request start to first
token generation
- **TPOT**: Time per output token (TPOT), the average time taken to generate
each output token
- **ITL**: Inter-token latency (ITL), the average time between consecutive token
or token-chunk generations
- **GPU utilization**: Percentage of time during which at least one GPU kernel
is being executed
- **Peak GPU memory used**: Peak memory usage during benchmark run

## Troubleshooting

### Memory issues

- Reduce batch size
- Check GPU memory availability: `nvidia-smi` or `rocm-smi`

### Permission issues

- Verify `HF_TOKEN` is set correctly
- Ensure model access on Hugging Face
