    """LoRA shrink GMM with planar Q/K/V output on SM100.

    Performs the LoRA 'shrink' grouped matmul for routed tokens:
    computes `[M, K] @ [G, 3N, K]^T` per active expert, then **permutes**
    the flat `[M, 3N]` result into a planar layout `[3, M, N]` (Q, K, V)
    using an elementwise epilogue, while reusing the same storage.

    Args:
        c_lora: Output tensor with planar Q/K/V layout, shape (3, M, N).
                Backed by row-major storage, used both as a 3D view and as a
                temporary 2D view (M, 3N) during compute.
        a:      Routed activation matrix, shape (M, K).
        b:      Shrink weights per expert, shape (G, 3N, K).
        a_offsets: Inclusive prefix sums of tokens per (active) expert,
                length (num_experts + 1). Defines per-expert [start, end) in A/C.
        expert_ids: Expert indices for the active groups, length ≥ num_active_experts.
        max_num_tokens_per_expert: Upper bound on tokens for any active expert.
        num_active_experts: Number of experts participating in this call.
        ctx:    DeviceContext used for enqueues and synchronization.

    Constraints:
        - c_lora must be rank 3 with static first dimension B == 3.
        - a must be rank 2 with trailing dimension K that matches b[..., K].
        - b must be rank 3 with shape (G, 3N, K).
        - The temporary 2D view of c_lora is (M, 3N) in row-major order and
        **aliases the same storage** as c_lora.
        - a_offsets is non-decreasing with a_offsets[0] == 0 and
        a_offsets[num_active_experts] == M.
        - expert_ids[i] ∈ [0, G) for valid experts; kernel may treat -1 as inactive.
        - The epilogue assumes `N % vector_width == 0` for aligned vector stores.
