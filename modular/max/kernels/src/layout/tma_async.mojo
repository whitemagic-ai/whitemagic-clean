Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) Asynchronous Operations Module

Provides high-performance abstractions for NVIDIA's Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA),
enabling efficient asynchronous data movement between global and shared memory in GPU kernels.
It is designed for use with NVIDIA Hopper architecture and newer GPUs that support TMA instructions.

Key Components:
--------------
- `TMATensorTile`: Core struct that encapsulates a TMA descriptor for efficient data transfers
  between global and shared memory with various access patterns and optimizations.

- `SharedMemBarrier`: Synchronization primitive for coordinating asynchronous TMA operations,
  ensuring data transfers complete before dependent operations begin.

- `PipelineState`: Helper struct for managing multi-stage pipeline execution with circular
  buffer semantics, enabling efficient double or triple buffering techniques.

- `create_tma_tile`: Factory functions for creating optimized `TMATensorTile` instances with
  various configurations for different tensor shapes and memory access patterns.

        Performs a partitioned multicast load where each rank loads a distinct slice of data.

        # Now lets say we want to store the first depth chunk (64) of the first batch (43) at head 7.

        # We would need to do a total of 2 stores, with the global coordinates naively being:
        # [(0, 7, 0, 0), (24, 7, 0, 0)] || [(0, 7, 0, 0), (0, 7, 24, 0)]

        # Both cases will cause spillage since 24 * 2 = 48.

        # Instead we will utilize the cumulative_length dimension and max_length dimension to mask the out of bounds
        # segments in each ragged store.

        # One prerequsite for this to work is that the starting pointer must be negatively offset by ragged_stride * max_length.
        # Which in our case is 2048 * 64 or 64 sequences.

        # Now to get bounds checked store we set the
        # cumulative_length dimension to the cumulative length of the preceding sequences + this sequence's length.
        # And we set the max_length dimension to the max_length - this sequence's length.

        # This would make our new coordinate starting global coordinates: [(43, 7, 21, 0), (43, 7, 45, 0)]

        # When adding 43 + 21 we get a starting offset of 64, which is how much we offset our orignal pointer. This gives

        - coords[1]: M coordinate (indexes into batch * H_out * W_out spatial)

        Internally:
        - K is decomposed into (c, r, s) where K = c*R*S + r*S + s

          the PTX im2col instruction with multicast.

        Note: The cta_group parameter defaults to 2 because SM100/Blackwell

        PTX format. This is consistent with CUTLASS which only provides

) raises -> TMATensorTileIm2col[dtype, __tile_layout, __desc_layout]:
    """Creates a TMA tensor tile with im2col transformation for 2D convolution.

    This factory function creates a TMA descriptor that performs hardware
    im2col transformation during loads. The descriptor encodes the convolution
    geometry and the TMA hardware computes addresses on-the-fly.

    For im2col TMA, each transaction loads one output pixel with multiple channels.
    This follows CUTLASS's approach where:
    - pixels_per_column = 1 (one pixel per TMA transaction)
    - channels_per_pixel = min(K_tile, swizzle_width) (contiguous channels)

    Parameters:
        dtype: The data type of tensor elements.
        tile_shape: Shape `[M_tile, K_tile]` for the GEMM tile.
            - M_tile: Number of output pixels (batch * H_out * W_out slice).
            - K_tile: Number of channels (C_in * R * S slice for filter).
        swizzle_mode: Memory swizzling pattern.
        __tile_layout: Internal layout parameter (full tile shape).
        __desc_layout: Internal descriptor layout parameter (TMA box shape).

    Args:
        ctx: The CUDA device context.
        tensor: The 4D activation tensor in NHWC layout.
        lower_corner_h: Lower corner offset for height (negative for padding).
        lower_corner_w: Lower corner offset for width (negative for padding).
        upper_corner_h: Upper corner offset for height.
        upper_corner_w: Upper corner offset for width.
        out_height: Output height (H_out) for M coordinate decomposition.
        out_width: Output width (W_out) for M coordinate decomposition.
        filter_h: Filter height (R) for K coordinate decomposition.
        filter_w: Filter width (S) for K coordinate decomposition.

    Returns:
        A TMATensorTileIm2col configured for im2col loads.

    Raises:
        Error if TMA descriptor creation fails.

    Note:
        For stride=1, dilation=1 convolution with padding (following CUTLASS convention):
        - lower_corner_h = -pad_h
        - lower_corner_w = -pad_w
        - upper_corner_h = pad_h - (filter_h - 1)
        - upper_corner_w = pad_w - (filter_w - 1)

        The filter offsets passed to the PTX instruction range from 0 to (filter_size - 1)
        and are added to lower_corner to compute actual input coordinates.
