"""This module provides functionality for interacting with accelerators. In

    methods for allocating buffers on the device, copying data between host and
    device, and for compiling and running functions (also known as kernels) on
    the device.

    The device context can be used as a

    ```mojo

    A custom operation receives an opaque `DeviceContextPtr`, which provides
    a `get_device_context()` method to retrieve the device context:

    ```mojo

        This function allocates memory on the host that is accessible by the device.
        The memory is page-locked (pinned) for efficient data transfer between host and device.

        Pinned memory is guaranteed to remain resident in the host's RAM, not be
        paged/swapped out to disk. Memory allocated normally (for example, using
        [`alloc()`](/mojo/std/memory/unsafe_pointer/alloc))
        is pageable—individual pages of memory can be moved to secondary storage
        (disk/SSD) when main memory fills up.

        Using pinned memory allows devices to make fast transfers
        between host memory and device memory, because they can use direct
        memory access (DMA) to transfer data without relying on the CPU.

        Allocating too much pinned memory can cause performance issues, since it
        reduces the amount of memory available for other processes.

        Parameters:
            dtype: The data type to be stored in the allocated memory.

        Args:
            size: The number of elements of `type` to allocate memory for.

        This function performs compile-time type checking on the kernel arguments,
        ensuring that the types passed match the declared signature. Both `func` and
        `signature_func` should typically be the same kernel function (this redundancy
        is required for type checking and will be removed in future versions).

        Parameters:
            func_type: The type of the function to launch (usually inferred).
            declared_arg_types: The declared argument types from the function
                signature (usually inferred).
            func: The kernel function to compile and launch.
            signature_func: The kernel function, passed again for type checking.
                Typically the same as `func`.
            actual_arg_types: The types of the arguments being passed (usually inferred).
            dump_asm: To dump the compiled assembly, pass `True`, or a file
                path to dump to, or a function returning a file path.
            dump_llvm: To dump the generated LLVM code, pass `True`, or a file
                path to dump to, or a function returning a file path.
            _dump_sass: Only runs on NVIDIA targets, and requires CUDA Toolkit
                to be installed. Pass `True`, or a file path to dump to, or a
                function returning a file path.
            _ptxas_info_verbose: Only runs on NVIDIA targets, and requires CUDA
                Toolkit to be installed. Changes `dump_asm` to output verbose
                PTX assembly (default `False`).

        Args:
            args: Variadic arguments which are passed to the kernel function.

            cluster_dim: The cluster dimensions.
            shared_mem_bytes: Per-block memory shared between blocks.
            attributes: A `List` of launch attributes.
            constant_memory: A `List` of constant memory mappings.
            func_attribute: `CUfunction_attribute` enum.
            location: Source location for the function call.

        Most parameters are inferred automatically. In typical usage, you only
        need to pass the kernel function twice (as both `func` and `signature_func`):

        This overload is for kernels that capture variables from their enclosing scope.

                path to dump to, or a function returning a file path.
            dump_llvm: To dump the generated LLVM code, pass `True`, or a file
                path to dump to, or a function returning a file path.

            grid_dim: The grid dimensions.
            block_dim: The block dimensions.

        This function detects all available accelerators in the system and enables

        When peer access is enabled, kernels running on one device can directly access
        memory allocated on another device without going through host memory. This is
        crucial for efficient multi-GPU operations like allreduce.

        The function is a no-op when:
        - No accelerators are available

        - Peer access is already enabled between devices
