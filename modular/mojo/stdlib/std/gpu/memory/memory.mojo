"""This module provides GPU memory operations and utilities.

The module implements low-level memory operations for GPU programming, with a focus on:

- Memory address space abstractions (global, shared, constant)
- Cache control operations and policies
- Memory access patterns and optimizations
- Memory alignment and pointer manipulation

It provides a unified interface for memory operations across different GPU architectures,
with specialized implementations for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs where needed.

The module is designed for performance-critical code and requires careful usage to
achieve optimal memory access patterns and cache utilization.

    This function performs a TMA load using im2col mode, which applies coordinate

    """Initiates an asynchronous multicast load operation using NVIDIA's Tensor Memory Access (TMA)
    to copy tensor data from global memory to shared memories of multiple CTAs in a cluster.

    This function performs an optimized multicast copy operation where a single global memory read
    can be distributed to multiple CTAs' shared memories simultaneously, reducing memory bandwidth
    usage. It supports both rank-1 and rank-2 tensors and uses cluster-level synchronization.

    Parameters:
        dst_type: The data type of the destination tensor elements.
        mbr_type: The data type of the memory barrier.
        rank: The dimensionality of the tensor (must be 1 or 2).
        cta_group: The CTA group to use for the copy operation. Must be 1 or 2.

    Args:
        dst_mem: Pointer to the destination in shared memory where the tensor data will be copied.
                Must be properly aligned according to TMA requirements.
        tma_descriptor: Pointer to the TMA descriptor containing metadata about tensor layout
                       and memory access patterns.
        mem_bar: Pointer to a shared memory barrier used for synchronizing the asynchronous copy
                operation across threads in the cluster.
        coords: Coordinates specifying which tile of the tensor to copy. For rank-1 tensors,
               this is a single coordinate. For rank-2 tensors, this contains both row and
               column coordinates.
        multicast_mask: A 16-bit bitmask where each bit corresponds to a CTA in the cluster.
                       Set bits indicate which CTAs will receive a copy of the loaded data.
                       This enables efficient data sharing across multiple CTAs.

    Notes:

    - This operation is asynchronous - use appropriate memory barriers to ensure copy completion.
    - Only supports rank-1 and rank-2 tensors.
    - Requires NVIDIA GPU with TMA support.
    - The memory barrier should be properly initialized before use.
    - The multicast_mask must be properly configured based on cluster size and desired distribution.
