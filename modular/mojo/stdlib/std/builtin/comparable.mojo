trait Equatable(ImplicitlyDestructible):
    """A type which can be compared for equality with other instances of itself.

    The `Equatable` trait has a default implementation of `__eq__()` that uses
    reflection to compare all fields. This means simple structs can conform to
    `Equatable` without implementing any methods:

    ```mojo
    @fieldwise_init
    struct Point(Equatable):
        var x: Int
        var y: Int

    var p1 = Point(1, 2)
    var p2 = Point(1, 2)
    print(p1 == p2)  # True
    ```

    All fields must conform to `Equatable`. Override `__eq__()` for custom
    equality semantics.

    Note: The default implementation performs memberwise equality comparison.
    This may not be appropriate for types containing floating-point fields
    (due to NaN semantics) or types requiring custom equality logic.
